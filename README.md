### Ray Tracing
Defined the intersection function for sphere where a ray hit an object in 3D space. Added angle around the camera so object looks smaller when camera goes further away which enhances the 3D effects. 

Adding plane in the scene created problem of uneven object shadowing that was solved making changes in intersection function.

### Attributes
Applied diffuse lightning, specular lighting, ray tranced shadows, bloom post-processing effect to solve uneven shadow problem.

Utilized HDRI skybox and animated image sequence for rendering.
